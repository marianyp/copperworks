Simply hold an item that needs to be charged and right click it on a placed battery. Batteries have limited charge and are functionally useless when they are completely drained of charged, being that they cannot be re-charged. Batteries second use allows for it to interact with other blocks. Use a Copper Rod on the head of the battery and connect a compatible block to the other end of the rod.

If a block with a comparator output is found, the Comparator Mirror will start emitting a looping redstone signal. The Comparator Mirror also has unique interactions with Crafters, Dispensers, and Droppers. For Crafters, the Comparator Mirror will attempt to check if all the enabled slots have more than 1 item. This is to make auto crafting slightly easier. For Dispensers and Droppers, the Comparator Mirror will force the Dispenser/Dropper into an off state shortly after powering it. This makes vertical and horizontal item transportation much easier. The Comparator Mirror can be locked with a wrench or battery interaction. This will temporarily disable the Comparator Mirror.",

  "gui.jei.info.block.copperworks.stasis_chamber": "When placing a charged Stasis Chamber, it will become bound to you until broken.
